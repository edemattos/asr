    "# ASR Labs 3 and 4 &ndash; Viterbi decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In these labs we'll use the experience &ndash; and code &ndash; you have developed in previous labs to develop your own Viterbi decoder.  You'll want to refer back to [Lecture 5](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/asr/2020-21/asr05-hmm-algorithms.pdf).  Remember that the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the joint probability of an observation sequence $X$ and the **best** path single path $Q$, allowing this best path to be efficiently discovered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your decoder will find the best path through the WFST representations HMMs that you developed in Labs 1 and 2.  In the case that your WFST is just a linear chain, the best path will provide an *alignment* of the observation sequence to the HMM states.  If your WFST is a set of word or phone loops (or any other structure) then the best path will allow you to recover the most likely transcription for the observed acoustic features, subject to the constraints of your grammar and vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation probabilities $b_j(t)$ will be supplied for you &ndash; you do not need to use the observations $(x_1, \\dotsc x_T)$ directly.  These are supplied via the `observation_model` module.  You can use this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import observation_model\n",
    "\n",
    "my_om = observation_model.ObservationModel()\n",
    "\n",
    "my_om.load_audio('filename.wav')  \n",
    "\n",
    "# or use dummy audio for debugging\n",
    "my_om.load_dummy_audio()  # will generate dummy observations as seen in Lab 2, \n",
    "                          # useful for testing\n",
    "    \n",
    "my_om.observation_length()  # returns the sequence length, T  \n",
    "\n",
    "my_om.log_observation_probability(hmm_label, t)  # returns log b_j(t) given HMM label in string form\n",
    "                                                 # raises IndexError if t > T\n",
    "                                                 # raises KeyError if hmm_label is not known\n",

For how to do this using the Viterbi algorithm, see Lecture 5, slides 11 onwards.\n",

As noted in the code, you'll need to create a structure to store $B_j(t)$, which stores the identity of the best preceding state reaching state $j$ at time $t$ .  You can follow a similar method to storing $V_j(t)$, given in the code already.  You'll need to add it to the `initialise_decoding()`, `forward_step()` and `finalise_decoding()` functions.\n",
